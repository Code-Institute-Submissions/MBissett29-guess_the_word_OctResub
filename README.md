# Guess the Word

Guess the word is a python terminal game that runs as a mock terminal app provided by Code Institute deployed on Heroku.

The game is based on the classic Hangman game, however instead of a image of a hangman every time you lose a life it just shows how many lives you have remaining.

## How to play

Guess the word is a pretty simple game. It starts off by welcoming the player and asks if they are ready to play.

It will also show  the player how many lives remaining, so they understands how many guesses they have to beat the game.

The game starts of by showing the random word as spaced out underscores for the letters. This shows the player how long the word is.

The player then has the option of guessing a letter each time by typing a letter into the terminal and hitting the enter key.

The game ends either if the player guesses the word and beats the game or the player runs out of lives.

The player then has the option of playing again.
